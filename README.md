# Nonlinear Equation Solver
Let's say we have initial equation: x = tan(x)

First method we are going to solve this equation is called fixed point iteration method:
1) And our first funtion which we will check if it converges would be g(x) = tan(x)
2) The point there g(x) = tan(x) and y = x intersects:
